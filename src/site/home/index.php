			<p>The Lincoln Lutheran Choir was founded in 1978 to provide its members and audiences first-hand exposure to the joy of singing and hearing the great choral literature of the church. The choir seeks to achieve three significant goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To preserve in performance the music of the churchâ€™s liturgical heritage of all ages, including the present</li>
				<li>To focus on the Lutheran choral heritage and the other similar repertoires (which have contributed to it), extending them by means of contemporary composition</li>
				<li>To encourage a lively appreciation of the vast and varied treasury of hymns of the church, particularly those arising within or compatible with Lutheran practice</li>
			</ul>
